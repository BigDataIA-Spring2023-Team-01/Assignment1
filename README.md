# Assignment1
GOES and NEXRAD Dataset Application



In this project we explore NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellities and Next Generation Weather Radar's dataset and developed an application using Streamlit to provide user the convenience to download the file of their choosing by selecting year, month, time of the day and file name. The application retrieves the file from our aws s3 bucket, providing the user with two download URL links - one from the s3 bucket and one from the website. 
We are also plotting the NEXRAD doppler radar's location using streamlit in which the data contains state, place,ICAO location identifiers and coordinates of the radars. Link to documentation and application is given below.
